The goal here is to keep all the up-to-date requirements and details in the main/primary description of a task.

Thus the developer will not have to look for the actual requirements in a long, descriptive text but he will be able to easily get to the essence. One might find that sometimes — when acceptance criteria are well defined — there is little or no need for any additional information. Example:
        a) User navigates to “/accounts” and clicks on red download CSV button
        b) Popup appears with two buttons: “This year” and “Last year”
        c) If user clicked on “Last year” download is initiated
        d) CSV downloaded includes following columns…`,
